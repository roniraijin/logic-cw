This repo is the accumulation of my work in creating a SAT Solver that could solve popular NP-Complete problems. I have multiple different files for my progress with my final submission being the skeletoncode file. All the other finals were simply used for local testing before the final submission of my code. The coursework had 4 different functions to develop which are shown in the skeletoncode file.
